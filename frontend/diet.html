            <h1>IMPORTANCE OF DIET AND NUTRITION</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="subheadofdiet">
            <h3>WHAT IS NUTRITION?</h3>

            <p>The development of human health is dependent mainly on nutrition. Improved nutrition boosts the immune system, makes pregnancies safer, increases mental alertness, and lowers the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc. A nutritious diet leads to a healthy pregnancy, lowers the risk of developing chronic diseases, and helps maintain a healthy body weight. According to the adage, ‘You are what you eat’, people who eat well are healthier and more productive than those who don’t.Eating inappropriate foods in your diet leads to malnutrition, which poses a serious risk to human health. Malnutrition, including being overweight and undernourished, is widespread in the modern world. The WHO offers specialised guidance and recommendations on malnutrition to promote health and well-being.</p>

            <h3>WHY IS NUTRITION IMPORTANT?</h3>

            <p>For the body to function properly, grow appropriately, and keep healthy, one must consume enough macronutrients (proteins, carbs, fats, and water) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).As we have noticed, processed, sweet, fatty, and salted foods drain the body and cannot function properly. On the other hand, consuming fresh, whole-natural meals fuels the body by producing the necessary energy, metabolic activity, micronutrient shortages, chronic disease prevention, general health promotion and well-being. Proteins, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre, and water are the seven main types of nutrients that the healthy human body requires to survive. We need a lot of macronutrients, although we can get by with fewer micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subheadofdiet">
            <h3>Proteins:</h3>

            <p>Our body’s immune system and muscles are both strengthened by protein. Protein consists of amino acids. And these amino acids are essential for our body to function correctly. Protein helps our bodies repair damaged cells and create new tissues. It supports the synthesis of enzymes and hormones. Vegetarian: lentils, low-fat dairy, tofu, almonds, seeds, and other legumes Non-vegetarian:Chicken, beef, fish, turkey, and other types of meat Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are considered to as energy providing foods. They give the body the energy it requires to function. Carbs account for up to 65% of our energy. Due to the ease of conversion into energy, they serve as the body’s primary fuel source. Typically, this energy takes the form of glucose, which all of our body’s tissues and cells can use immediately. Simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates are two different types of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main reason for the production of ketones. Good examples of carbohydrates are bread, potatoes, pasta, soda, chips, cookies/biscuits, puddings, cakes, sugar, bananas, etc.</p>

            <h3>Fats:</h3>

            <p>Including fats in your diet is crucial because they can give your body energy. While some forms of dietary fats (Monounsaturated fatty acids and Poly unsaturated fatty acids) may be better for you than others (Saturated fatty acids and Trans-fat), they are still a vital element of your diet and help your body produce hormones, grow cells, store energy, and absorb vitamins. Fat is essential for healthy skin and blood pressure regulation. Saturated fats and Unsaturated fats are the two different varieties of fats. Saturated fats are present in products like cream, butter, cheese, and some chocolates. Some of the unsaturated fats are sunflower, soybean, cardamon, and corn oils.</p>

        <div class="subheadofdiet">
            <h3>Vitamins:</h3>

            <p>Vitamins are essential compounds that play an important role in making our body function properly. Some of them are vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12. We receive most of these vitamins daily. Our body naturally tends to produce vitamins like D and K.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subheadofdiet">
            <h3>Minerals:</h3>

            <p>Compared to trace minerals, macrominerals are needed in greater quantities. The significant macrominerals and their roles comprise: Calcium: Essential for the healthy structure and operation of bones Phosphorus: A component of cell membranes Magnesium: Enzyme reactions Sodium: Blood pressure maintenance and fluid balance Chloride Promotes the production of digestive juices and maintains fluid balance Potassium: Muscle contraction and the transmission of nerve impulses Sulfur is a substance found in all living tissues On the other hand, trace minerals are needed in tiny amounts but have several vital roles in our bodies. Some of the crucial trace minerals required by the body are selenium, iodine, iodine salts, copper, zinc, manganese, copper, and iron.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subheadofdiet">
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

            <p>A healthy diet ensures that your body receives all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs to function at its peak. Plan your meals and snacks to include nutrient-rich, low-calorie foods.</p>
